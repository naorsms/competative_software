Hello, we are going to implement a real life (but simple) web service.

(Preparation) First step (first_step.txt):
    Create the service and make sure you understand its components.

(Preparation) Second step (second_step.txt):
    Containerize the server. Create a dockerfile to hold all the components from the first step.

(Main) Third step (third_step.txt):
    This is the main part!
    (1) Your Dockerfile may be not correct - it might be not finished.
    (2) Even your service from the steps above allowed to be down - 404 is fine.

    This is the main part!
    (1) It must be implemented.

    Dockerfile generator. Please see details in the third_step.txt
